# Beads Configuration File
# This file configures default behavior for all br commands in this repository
# All settings can also be set via environment variables (BR_* prefix)
# or overridden with command-line flags

# Issue prefix for this repository (used by br init)
# If not set, br init will auto-detect from directory name
# Example: issue-prefix: "myproject" creates issues like "myproject-1", "myproject-2", etc.
# issue-prefix: ""

# Use no-db mode: load from JSONL, write back after each command
# When true, br will use .beads/issues.jsonl as the source of truth
# instead of the SQLite database
# no-db: false

# Enable JSON output by default
# json: false

# Default actor for audit trails (overridden by BR_ACTOR or --actor)
# actor: ""

# Debounce interval for auto-flush (can also use BEADS_FLUSH_DEBOUNCE)
# flush-debounce: "5s"

# Export events (audit trail) to .beads/events.jsonl on each flush/sync
# When enabled, new events are appended incrementally using a high-water mark.
# Use 'br export --events' to trigger manually regardless of this setting.
# events-export: false

# Git branch for beads commits (br sync will commit to this branch)
# IMPORTANT: Set this for team projects so all clones use the same sync branch.
# This setting persists across clones (unlike database config which is gitignored).
# Can also use BEADS_SYNC_BRANCH env var for local override.
# If not set, br sync will require you to run 'br config set sync.branch <branch>'.
# sync-branch: "beads-sync"

# Multi-repo configuration (experimental)
# Allows hydrating from multiple repositories and routing writes to the correct JSONL
# repos:
#   primary: "."  # Primary repo (where this database lives)
#   additional:   # Additional repos to hydrate from (read-only)
#     - ~/beads-planning  # Personal planning repo
#     - ~/work-planning   # Work planning repo

# Integration settings (access with 'br config get/set')
# These are stored in the database, not in this file:
# - jira.url
# - jira.project
# - linear.url
# - linear.api-key
# - github.org
# - github.repo
