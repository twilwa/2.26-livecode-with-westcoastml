# Tasks

## 1. Setup

- [x] 1.1 Create `tetris.html` with basic HTML5 structure and a `<canvas>` element (e.g., 300x600 for 10x20 blocks of 30px).
- [x] 1.2 Add CSS to center the game canvas on the screen.

## 2. Rendering Logic

- [x] 2.1 Set up JS Canvas context and a `requestAnimationFrame` game loop.
- [x] 2.2 Implement `drawGrid()`: draw the 10x20 grid background.
- [x] 2.3 Implement `drawPiece()`: define a T-piece object (x, y, shape matrix, color) and render it.
- [x] 2.4 Update the game loop to make the piece fall over time (e.g., move down every second).
