# Proposal

## Why
We need to establish the foundational rendering system for a browser-based Tetris game using HTML5 Canvas.

## What Changes
- Create a single HTML file `tetris.html` containing the Canvas element, CSS, and vanilla JS.
- Implement the game loop, a 10x20 grid, and the rendering logic for a single falling tetromino (e.g., the T-piece).

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `tetris-rendering`: Renders a 10x20 grid and a single active tetromino.

## Impact
- `tetris.html`: A new file containing all the logic, styling, and markup for the game.
