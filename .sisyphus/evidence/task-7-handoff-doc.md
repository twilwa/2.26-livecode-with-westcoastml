# Task 7: Update docs/planning/br-bv-migration-handoff.md — Evidence

## Changes Made

- Added "## Migration Status: COMPLETED" section at top of file
- Historical `bd` references in the body were intentionally preserved (this is a planning artifact documenting the migration itself, so historical context is appropriate)

## Commit

- Part of commit `30a3eea` (`docs: update all references from bd to br`)

## Verification

- File contains migration completion status at top
- Historical references preserved for context
